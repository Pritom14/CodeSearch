**Commit Style Guide**

A commit message consists of three parts, the title, the body and an optional footer.

**Title**

The title consists of the type of message and body. The type is contained within the title and can be one of these types :
 * feat: a new feature
 * fix: a bug fix
 * docs: changes to documentation
 * style: formatting, missing semicolons, etc; no code change
 * refractor: refactoring production code
 * test: adding tests, refactoring test; no production code change
 * chore: updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no production code change

**The Subject**

Subjects should be no greater than 50 characters, should begin with a capital letter and not end with a period.

Use an imperative tone for what the commit does rather than what it did, For example, use test; and not testing.

**The Body**

It is optional and should only be used when a commit requires a bit of explanation and context. When writing a body, the blank line between title and body is required and we should limit the length of each line to no more than 72 characters.

**The Footer**

The footer is optional an is used to reference issue tracker IDs, for example: fixes: #71
